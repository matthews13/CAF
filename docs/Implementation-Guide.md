# Implementation Guideline

There are two categories of activities that must take place in order to implement the “North Star” architecture.

1. **What-must-be-true** for a the “North Star”
    -   Encompasses activities that must be performed by the Azure and AAD administrators to establish an initial configuration; these are sequential by nature and primarily one-off activities.

2. **File -&gt; New -&gt; Region** and **File -&gt; New -&gt; Landing Zone**
    -   These are reoccurring activities that are required to instantiate a “Landing Zone” and require user input to kickstart the workflow which will coordinate resource creation within AAD and AD.
    -   To operationalize at scale, it is paramount that these activities follow the principal of “Infrastructure-as-Code” and automated using deployment pipelines.

## 2.  **File -&gt; New -&gt; Region** and **File -&gt; New -&gt; Landing Zone**

## File -&gt; New -&gt; Region

1.  Within the “Connectivity” subscription, create a new VHub within the existing Azure VWAN.

2.  Protect VHub with Azure Firewall Manager by deploying an Azure Firewall within the VHub.

3.  Connect the VHub to on-premises using ExpressRoute or alternatively via VPN.

4.  Allocate an appropriate VNet CIDR range for the VHub and any VNets to be connected to the VHub.

5.  Enable VHub to VHub connectivity across Azure regions.

6.  If it is the first/primary region, provision an AAD DS instance in primary location (optional)

## File -&gt; New -&gt; “Landing Zone” for Applications and Workloads

1.  Create a Subscription and assign the requestor as the “Subscription Owner”.

2.  Assign the Subscription within the Management Group Hierarchy.

3.  Set a Budget and Alert Notifications.

4.  Setup a security contact email address and phone number.

5.  Create AAD groups for the Subscription (N) – Owner, Reader, Contributor etc.

6.  Create AAD PIM entitlements for established AAD groups.

7.  Provision the VNet CIDR range if it requires VNet connectivity\*.

8.  Peer the VNet with the regional VHub \*.

9.  Provision required shared services, e.g. Domain Controllers\*

10. Assign required policies for the Subscription scope as mandated by the policy matrix defined by organization.

\*optional for Sandbox subscriptions.

The table below provides a list of example Azure Policies to enforce typical enterprise controls at a Subscription scope.
