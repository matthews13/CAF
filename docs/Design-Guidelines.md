# Design Guidelines
At the centre of the “North Star” architecture lies a critical design path, comprised of fundamental design topics with heavily interrelated and dependent design decisions. This repository provides design guidance across these architecturally significant technical domains to support the critical design decisions which must occur to define the “North Star” architecture. For each of the considered domains, readers should review provided considerations and recommendations, using them to structure and drive designs within each area.

For example, a customer is likely to question how many subscriptions they require for their estate. In this instance, the reader should review the *C - Management Group and Subscription Organisation -&gt; 2. Subscription Organization and Governance* section, using the outlined recommendations to help drive subscription decisions.

## Critical Design Areas
The following eight critical design areas are intended to support the translation of customer requirements to Azure constructs and capabilities, to address the mismatch between on-premises infrastructure and cloud-design which typically creates dissonance and friction with respect to the "North Star" definition and Azure adoption. 

The impact of decisions made within these critical areas will reverberate across the "North Star" architecture and influence other decisions. Readers are strongly advised to familiarize themselves with these eight areas, to better understand the consequences of encompassed decisions, which may later produce trade-offs within related areas.
